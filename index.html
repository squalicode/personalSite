            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>
                Hi! I'm a designer, craftsman, artist and (most recently) web developer currently based in Barcelona, Spain.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe code is also a craft, and as such ruled by the desire to make efficient, robust and usable objects through technical skill. I am specially interested in web sustainability and accessibility of all types.
            </p>
            <p>
                I became interested in programming while I was studying my art and design degree. I taught myself how to code while making personal algorithmic art projects, as well as parametrically designed pieces over at <a href="https://coudre.studio/">Coudre Studio</a>. I am now interested in a stable job in web development, and have attended my first formal programming course centered on front-end development in 2022. Feel free to learn more about my career path over at the <a href="./skills.html">skills</a> page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides coding I also enjoy gardening, swimming, ceramics, reading non-fiction and being busy with any new small interest I'm discovering at that time.
